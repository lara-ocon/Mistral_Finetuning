In people without hemorrhage, signs and symptoms of a brain AVM may include: Some people may experience more-serious neurological signs and symptoms, depending on the location of the AVM, including: Symptoms may begin at any age but usually emerge between ages 10 and 40. Brain AVMs can damage brain tissue over time. The effects slowly build up and often cause symptoms in early adulthood. Once you reach middle age, however, brain AVMs tend to remain stable and are less likely to cause symptoms. Some pregnant women may have worsened symptoms due to changes in blood volume and blood pressure. One severe type of brain AVM, called a vein of Galen defect, causes signs and symptoms that emerge soon or immediately after birth. The major blood vessel involved in this type of brain AVM can cause fluid to build up in the brain and the head to swell. Signs and symptoms include swollen veins that are visible on the scalp, seizures, failure to thrive and congestive heart failure. Seek immediate medical attention if you notice any signs or symptoms of a brain AVM, such as seizures, headaches or other symptoms.

These aggressive symptoms can include seizures, speech or language issues, face pain, dementia, Parkinsonism, coordination issues, burning or prickling sensations, weakness, apathy, failure to thrive, and symptoms related to increased pressure such as headaches, nausea and vomiting. More benign dAVF symptoms can include both hearing issues (often a bruit behind the ear, also known as pulsatile tinnitus) and vision problems including visual deterioration, eye bulge, swelling in the eye lining, eye-related palsies and cavernous sinus syndrome.

    "Response": "When osteomalacia is in its early stages, you might not have any symptoms, although signs of osteomalacia may be apparent on an X-ray or other diagnostic tests. As osteomalacia progresses, you might develop bone pain and muscle weakness. The dull, aching pain associated with osteomalacia most commonly affects the lower back, pelvis, hips, legs and ribs. The pain might be worse at night, or when you put pressure on the bones, and are rarely relieved completely by rest. Decreased muscle tone and leg weakness can cause a waddling gait and make walking slower and more difficult."

    "Response": "Pericarditis has different classification types, depending on the pattern of symptoms and how long symptoms last. Acute pericarditis usually lasts less than three weeks. Incessant pericarditis lasts about four to six weeks but less than three months and is continuous. Pericarditis is described as recurrent if it occurs about four to six weeks after an episode of acute pericarditis with a symptom-free interval in between. Pericarditis is considered chronic if symptoms last longer than three months. If you have acute pericarditis, the most common symptom is sharp, stabbing chest pain behind the breastbone or in the left side of my chest. However, some people with acute pericarditis describe their chest pain as dull, achy or pressure-like instead, and of varying intensity. The pain of acute pericarditis may travel into my left shoulder and neck. It often intensifies when you cough, lie down or inhale deeply. Sitting up and leaning forward can often ease the pain. At times, it may be difficult to distinguish pericardial pain from the pain that occurs with a heart attack. Chronic pericarditis is usually associated with chronic inflammation and may result in fluid around the heart (pericardial effusion). The most common symptom of chronic pericarditis is chest pain. Depending on the type, signs and symptoms of pericarditis may include some or all of the following: Seek immediate medical care if you develop new symptoms of chest pain. Many of the symptoms of pericarditis are similar to those of other heart and lung conditions. The sooner you are evaluated, the sooner you can receive proper diagnosis and treatment. For example, although the cause of acute chest pain may be pericarditis, the original cause could have been a heart attack or a blood clot of the lungs (pulmonary embolus). Sharp, piercing chest pain over the center or left side of the chest, which is generally more intense when breathing in Shortness of breath when reclining Heart palpitations Low-grade fever An overall sense of weakness, fatigue or feeling sick Cough Abdominal or leg swelling"

But the disease progresses slowly, and the more painful symptoms may not emerge until adulthood. The World Health Organization has identified five stages in the development of trachoma: All the signs of trachoma are more severe in my upper lid than in my lower lid. With advanced scarring, my upper lid may show a thick line. In addition, the lubricating glandular tissue in my lids \u2014 including the tear-producing glands (lacrimal glands) \u2014 can be affected. This can lead to extreme dryness, aggravating the problem even more. Call my doctor if you or my child has itchy or irritated eyes or discharge from the eyes, especially if you live in or recently traveled to an area where trachoma is common.

Repeated infections lead to scarring of the inner eyelid. The scars often appear as white lines when examined with magnification. My eyelid may become distorted and may turn in (entropion). Ingrown eyelashes (trichiasis). The scarred inner lining of my eyelid continues to deform, causing my lashes to turn in so that they rub on and scratch the transparent outer surface of my eye (cornea). Corneal clouding. The cornea becomes affected by an inflammation that is most commonly seen under my upper lid. Continual inflammation compounded by scratching from the in-turned lashes leads to clouding of the cornea."

The adults then produce larvae that migrate through various tissues, including muscle tissue, shown here. Abdominal symptoms can occur one to two days after infection.

Mild cases of trichinosis \u2014 those with only a small number of parasites in my body \u2014 may cause no recognizable signs or symptoms. Symptoms can develop with moderate or heavy infestation, sometimes progressing as the parasite travels through my body. You swallow trichinella larvae encased in a cyst. My digestive juices dissolve the cyst, releasing the parasite into my body. The larvae then penetrate the wall of the small intestine, where they mature into adult worms and mate. At this stage, you may experience: About a week after infection, the adult female worms produce larvae that go through the intestinal wall, enter my bloodstream, and eventually burrow into muscle or other tissue.
